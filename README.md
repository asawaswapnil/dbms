Shopping mall sells a great variety of goods. Managers of the shopping mall are interested in these questions: how many goods are sold; how many inventories remain; which kinds of goods are popular; in which season they are popular; which kinds customers spend more money in this mall, what is the profit on any product; what is the total profit the mall is making and the profit trend over time, etc. To answer these questions, managers need to collect lots of data, such as, daily and seasonal sales for each kind of good; the information of customers who buy certain types of goods; different sellers from which the mall buys the goods; inventories for each types of goods; transections details for every item sold, and so on. Since a shopping mall sells a great variety of goods, we need to create a database management system to record a mass of data and efficiently query from the data. The database management must be stable and user friendly. 

Check the project report for more details. 


Instructions:
